# Nigeria-First Tax Guide for Businesses (CRM Context)

This CRM is configured for Nigerian businesses first.

## 1. Registration and TIN

- Register your business with the `Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)`.
- Obtain a `Tax Identification Number (TIN)` for tax compliance.
- Use your TIN for filing, remittance, and tax clearance processes.

## 2. Key Taxes Nigerian Businesses Should Track

## Company Income Tax (CIT)

Paid on company profit to `FIRS`.

- `Small company`: up to `₦25,000,000` turnover -> `0% CIT`
- `Medium company`: above `₦25,000,000` and below `₦100,000,000` turnover -> `20% CIT`
- `Large company`: `₦100,000,000+` turnover -> `30% CIT`

## Value Added Tax (VAT)

- Standard VAT rate: `7.5%`
- Charged on taxable goods/services, collected from customers, remitted to `FIRS`

## Withholding Tax (WHT)

- Advance tax credit deducted at source (often `5%` or `10%`, depending on transaction type)
- Common in contracts, rent, management/professional payments, interest/dividends, etc.

## Personal Income Tax (PIT)

## Other Levies/Charges (case-dependent)

- `Education Tax` (for qualifying companies, based on assessable profit)
- `Stamp Duties` on dutiable instruments/documents

## 3. Compliance and Filing

- Keep complete records: invoices, receipts, expenses, payroll, bank statements, financial statements.
- CIT returns are typically due `6 months` after financial year-end.
- Use the `FIRS TaxPro Max` portal for federal tax filing/remittance where applicable.
- Reconcile WHT credits and VAT schedules monthly to avoid audit issues.

## 4. Practical CRM Tax Setup (Nigeria)

- Default transaction tax is set to `7.5%` (Nigeria VAT-style default).
- Currency format is set to `NGN (₦)`.
- Update tax rate in Settings only if your business requires a different rule.
